## Flutter Clean Architecture with Cubit & TDD
This repository is a Flutter project sample demonstrating Clean Architecture with Cubit and Test-Driven Development (TDD). The app is structured into three layers to ensure scalability and maintainability:

Domain Layer – Contains business logic and use cases.

Data Layer – Manages repositories, API calls, and local storage.

UI Layer – Handles presentation logic using Cubit for state management.

Testing
The project follows a TDD approach, ensuring reliability through:
Unit Tests – Testing individual functions and business logic.
Widget Tests – Verifying UI components and interactions.
Integration Tests – Ensuring smooth app flow and API interactions.

This sample serves as a best-practice guide for structuring large-scale Flutter apps with Clean Architecture and Cubit while maintaining high test coverage for robust applications.
